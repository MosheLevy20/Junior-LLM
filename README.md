## Multi-File Edits

![Multi-File Edits](./static/edits1.gif)

Junior has access to your current workspace. Saying "add new feature X" will result in a series of modifications in multiple files, resulting in the requested feature.

All edits are streamed in real time to diffs, where you can accept, reject, or modify changes.

## From Scratch

![New Projects](./static/scratch.gif)

You can also create new projects from scratch by simply describing them. Junior will create the necessary files and populate them with code.

## Large Codebases

![Context](./static/context.gif)

Junior handles large codebases by automatically pulling only relevant code into its context. You can view and modify this context inline.

![Search](./static/search.gif)

You can also utilize this backend search manually to jump to relevant portions of code.
